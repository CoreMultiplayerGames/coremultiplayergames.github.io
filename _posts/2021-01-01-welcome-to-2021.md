20 years ago I joined Sony Computer Entertainment Europe - Special Projects. 
My role was the Special Projects Programmer. Responsible for maintenance of the Official PlayStation 2 Magazine Demo Disc.

About 18 months later I was working on the Network Access Disc for PlayStation 2. That is where my career in networking/online programmer started.
I say started, as I spent my days at University actively avoiding anything to do with networking!

{% highlight cpp %}
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
  printf("Hello World!\n");

  return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

What is the purpose of this blog/site/random musings? 
To drop some bits of knowledge and experience in multiplayer game development.
It will start of with [Unreal Engine 4][unreal-engine-4] as that is my current experience.
